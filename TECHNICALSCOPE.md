# Vulnerability Scanning Tools and Expanded Technical Scope

## Vulnerability Scanning Tools

The selection of vulnerability scanning tools should align with the WSTG guidelines and industry best practices. Given the focus on open-source solutions, here are some obvious choices for inclusion in the evaluation procedure:

- **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)**: ZAP is a highly regarded open-source web application security scanner. It's well-suited for both automated and manual vulnerability detection and offers a wide range of features for comprehensive testing. The sources recommend ZAP, describing it as an "easy to use integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications" [1].
- **Nikto**: Another popular open-source web server scanner is Nikto. It excels at identifying common server misconfigurations and outdated software versions, both of which can introduce security risks.
- **SQLMap**: This open-source tool specialises in detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities, which are particularly relevant in the context of web applications interacting with databases. The sources recommend SQLMap, describing it as an "automatic SQL injection tool" [2].
- **Wapiti**: Wapiti is another robust open-source option that performs black-box testing for a wide range of web application vulnerabilities, including cross-site scripting (XSS) and file inclusion flaws.

The evaluation procedure should incorporate these tools to automatically scan government websites and applications for known vulnerabilities.

## Expanded Technical Scope

Expanding on the initial technical scope, this section provides more detail on the tools and procedures for evaluating Indian Government websites against GIGW 3.0.

### 1. Automated Testing Infrastructure:

- **Cloud-Based Scanning Platform**: To handle the scale of evaluating over 5,000 websites, a cloud-based scanning platform is recommended. This platform would host the open-source scanning tools and provide the necessary infrastructure for automated testing, data collection, and report generation.
- **Scalable Architecture**: The platform's architecture should be designed to scale horizontally, allowing for the addition of more computing resources as the number of websites under evaluation increases.

### 2. Evaluation Procedure and Toolchain:

- **Website Crawling and Mapping**: The first step involves using a web crawler, such as those integrated into OWASP ZAP or other open-source tools, to automatically crawl the target websites. This process gathers information about the website's structure, links, and resources.
- **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**: Once crawled, the websites will undergo automated vulnerability scanning using the selected tools (OWASP ZAP, Nikto, SQLMap, Wapiti). Each tool should be configured to run a comprehensive set of tests relevant to the GIGW 3.0 security guidelines.
- **Performance and Accessibility Testing**: Alongside security testing, automated performance and accessibility evaluations will be conducted using tools like Lighthouse. This process generates quantitative data on page load times, accessibility compliance, and adherence to best practices.
- **Results Aggregation and Prioritisation**: The results from the various scanning tools and performance tests will be aggregated into a central database. Vulnerabilities will be prioritised based on their severity and potential impact, using industry-standard vulnerability scoring systems like CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System).

### 3. Reporting and Remediation Guidance:

- **Detailed Technical Reports**: The evaluation procedure will generate detailed technical reports for each website, outlining identified vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and accessibility issues. Reports should include specific remediation advice tailored to the issue and the technology used by the website.
- **Integration with Development Workflows**: To streamline remediation efforts, consider integrating the evaluation toolchain with existing government development workflows. This could involve automatically creating tickets in bug tracking systems or notifying development teams of new findings.

### 4. GIGW 3.0-Specific Checks:

- **Bilingual Support Validation**: The evaluation procedure will incorporate checks for bilingual support, ensuring websites are available in both Hindi and English as required by GIGW 3.0.
- **Unicode Character Encoding**: Automated tests will verify that websites utilise Unicode character encoding to ensure proper display of all Indian languages.
- **Adherence to Specific Guidelines**: The evaluation toolchain will be customised to explicitly check for compliance with specific GIGW 3.0 guidelines, such as those related to content organisation, navigation, and accessibility features.

By implementing these detailed technical steps and leveraging the capabilities of open-source tools, the evaluation procedure can effectively assess the compliance of Indian Government websites with GIGW 3.0 guidelines, ultimately contributing to a more secure, accessible, and user-friendly online experience for citizens.

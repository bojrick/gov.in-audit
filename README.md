# Government Website Security and Performance Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive security check and performance analysis of government websites, starting with a single state and potentially expanding to others. The goal is to improve the overall security posture of government digital infrastructure, protect citizens from potential scams, and enhance the user experience of these essential online services.

## Project Goals

1. Analyze government websites using Lighthouse for basic performance metrics
2. Conduct security assessments of government websites
3. Perform cost analysis for security improvements
4. Create a dashboard for monitoring website status and security breaches
5. Identify responsible departments for each website

## Phase 1: Lighthouse Performance Analysis

In the initial stage of the project, we will use Google Lighthouse to generate basic reports on performance and other metrics for each government website within the chosen state. This will help us establish a baseline for website performance and identify areas for improvement.

### Objectives:

- Set up automated Lighthouse testing for all identified government websites
- Collect and analyze performance metrics, including:
  - Page load time
  - First Contentful Paint (FCP)
  - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
  - Time to Interactive (TTI)
  - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Generate reports highlighting performance issues and potential optimizations
- Prioritize websites based on their performance scores and impact on citizens

## Future Phases

### Phase 2: Security Assessment
- Conduct in-depth security audits of government websites
- Identify vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors
- Assess compliance with security best practices and regulations

### Phase 3: Cost Analysis
- Estimate the cost of implementing necessary security fixes
- Analyze the potential financial impact of security breaches on citizens
- Develop a cost-benefit analysis for proposed security improvements

### Phase 4: Dashboard Development
- Create a centralized dashboard for monitoring website status
- Implement a flagging system for security breaches and performance issues
- Integrate responsible department information for each website

### Phase 5: Expansion and Replication
- Extend the analysis to other states
- Develop a standardized methodology for assessing government websites
- Create a nationwide overview of government website security and performance

## Expected Outcomes

1. Improved security and performance of government websites
2. Reduced risk of data breaches and scams targeting citizens
3. Increased transparency in government digital infrastructure
4. Cost-effective recommendations for enhancing online government services
5. A replicable model for ongoing assessment and improvement of government websites

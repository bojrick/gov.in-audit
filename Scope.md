# Open-Source Evaluation Procedure for Government Web Applications based on GIGW 3.0

This document outlines the scope for creating an open-source evaluation procedure focusing on the granular assessment of Indian Government web applications. This procedure will adhere to GIGW 3.0 while incorporating advanced techniques such as Lighthouse API for front-end performance analysis and in-depth vulnerability detection methods outlined in research papers. Taking into account the research paper you mentioned which tested 100 websites and the large number of Indian Government websites (over 5,000 [1]), the scope acknowledges the need for scalability and efficiency in the evaluation process.

## 1. Introduction

This open-source evaluation procedure aims to assist government organisations in India in assessing their web applications' compliance with GIGW 3.0 guidelines. The procedure will adopt a granular approach, providing detailed testing methodologies and leveraging modern tools for a comprehensive evaluation. This will be particularly important given that only a small fraction of Indian Government websites currently meet the required standard [1].

## 2. Target Audience

This evaluation procedure is designed to be used by:

- Government organisations responsible for developing and maintaining web applications.
- Website and application developers working on government projects.
- Independent auditors and evaluators assessing government web applications for GIGW 3.0 compliance.

## 3. Scope

This evaluation procedure will encompass the four core focus areas outlined in GIGW 3.0:

### Quality:
- **Content Accuracy and Currency**: Verification of information authenticity and regular updates.
- **Language Clarity**: Assessment of language comprehensibility and plain language usage.
- **Branding and Visual Consistency**: Examination of adherence to government branding guidelines and consistent visual design.
- **Copyright Compliance**: Verification of proper attribution and permissions for third-party content.

### Accessibility:
- **WCAG 2.1 Compliance**: Evaluating adherence to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1, Level AA.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Testing the operability of all functionalities using only the keyboard.
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Ensuring compatibility with assistive technologies like screen readers.
- **Responsive Design**: Assessing adaptability to various screen sizes and devices.

### Cybersecurity:
- **Security Audits**: Verifying completion of security audits by certified agencies (e.g., NIC, STQC, CERT-In empanelled labs) [2].
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Utilising automated tools to identify common vulnerabilities, complemented by manual testing for in-depth analysis. This will draw on OWASP guidelines, particularly the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities [2], and the vulnerabilities identified in your research paper.
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Evaluating the implementation of secure coding guidelines, drawing from standards like OWASP ASVS [2].

### Lifecycle Management:
- **Website Policies**: Reviewing the presence and completeness of essential policies, including copyright, privacy, content management, and accessibility policies [3].
- **Content Update Mechanisms**: Assessing the procedures for content review, updates, and archival [3].
- **Web Information Manager (WIM)**: Verifying the appointment of a dedicated WIM and their responsibilities [4]. The evaluation will consider the WIM's role in website quality, accessibility, and security [5, 6].

## 4. Methodology

This evaluation procedure will combine automated testing, manual review, and documentation analysis.

### 4.1 Automated Testing:
- **Lighthouse API Integration**: Leverage Lighthouse API for evaluating web application front-end performance, focusing on metrics like:
  - **Performance**: Measuring page load speed, responsiveness, and resource optimisation.
  - **Accessibility**: Identifying accessibility issues and providing recommendations for improvement.
  - **Best Practices**: Evaluating adherence to web development best practices for security and performance.
- **Vulnerability Scanning Tools**: Employ open-source vulnerability scanning tools to detect common web application vulnerabilities as outlined in OWASP Top 10 and research papers.
- **Automated Accessibility Checks**: Automated tools will be used to identify potential accessibility issues based on WCAG guidelines.

### 4.2 Manual Review
- **Accessibility Testing**: Manual testing by individuals with disabilities using various assistive technologies to supplement automated accessibility testing.
- **Content Review**: Manual examination of content for accuracy, clarity, and relevance.
- **Policy and Documentation Review**: Examining website policies for completeness and compliance with GIGW 3.0.

### 4.3 Documentation Analysis
Reviewing existing website documentation related to development practices, security policies, and content management procedures.

## 5. Deliverables

This project will deliver:

- **Open-Source Evaluation Tool**: A publicly accessible tool incorporating automated tests for front-end performance, accessibility, and common vulnerabilities.
- **Evaluation Procedure Documentation**: A comprehensive guide detailing the evaluation methodology, including:
  - Step-by-step instructions for conducting each test.
  - Interpretation of test results.
  - Recommendations for addressing identified issues.
- **Reporting Templates**: Templates for generating detailed evaluation reports, which could be adapted for different stakeholders (e.g., technical teams, management).

## 6. Granular Evaluation Approach

This evaluation procedure distinguishes itself by its granular approach.

- **Front-End Performance (Lighthouse API)**: Going beyond basic performance metrics, the procedure will leverage Lighthouse API to offer detailed insights into front-end performance bottlenecks and optimisation opportunities.
- **In-Depth Vulnerability Detection**: This procedure will incorporate vulnerability detection techniques from research papers and utilise a combination of automated and manual approaches to provide a comprehensive security assessment.
- **Specific GIGW 3.0 Checkpoints**: The evaluation will assess compliance with specific GIGW 3.0 guidelines, like the requirement for websites to be bilingual and use Unicode characters [7-13].

## 7. Open-Source Framework and Collaboration

The evaluation procedure will be developed as an open-source project, encouraging contributions and improvements from the community. This fosters transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement of the evaluation process.

## 8. Challenges

This project might encounter several challenges:

- **Scale of Evaluation**: Evaluating over 5,000 websites necessitates efficient automation and potentially a phased approach, starting with high-priority or high-traffic websites.
- **Diverse Technologies**: Indian Government websites likely use various technologies and Content Management Systems (CMS). The evaluation procedure must be adaptable to this diversity.
- **Resource Allocation**: Implementing the evaluation procedure requires resources, including personnel, tools, and potentially training for government staff.
- **Keeping Up-to-Date**: Ensuring the evaluation procedure remains current with evolving web technologies, security threats, and GIGW updates is an ongoing challenge.

## 9. Reporting Scope: Economic Impact

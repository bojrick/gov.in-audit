* **Submit a Pull Request:**  You can directly contribute code or documentation changes to the project by submitting a pull requests. This could include:
    * Enhancing the functionality of the open-source evaluation tool
    * Adding new tests or checks to the evaluation procedure
    * Improving the documentation and reporting templates
    * Expanding the scope of the project to include additional states or websites
* **Share Your Expertise:** We value your knowledge and experience. Share your insights on security best practices, performance optimization techniques, or relevant government regulations. 
* **Spread the Word:**  Help us raise awareness about the importance of government website security and performance by sharing this project with your network.

## Getting Started

Before you start contributing, please take some time to familiarize yourself with the project's goals, scope, and methodology as outlined in the project README and scope document.  This will help you understand the context of your contributions and ensure they align with the project's overall direction.

## Contribution Guidelines

To ensure a smooth and collaborative contribution process, please adhere to the following guidelines:

* **Follow the GIGW 3.0 Guidelines:** All contributions should align with the principles and requirements outlined in the GIGW 3.0 guidelines for Indian government websites. 
* **Adhere to Coding Standards:**  When contributing code, please follow established coding conventions and best practices. Ensure your code is well-documented and easy to understand. 
* **Test Your Changes:** Before submitting a pull request, thoroughly test your changes to ensure they function as expected and do not introduce any new issues. 
* **Be Respectful and Inclusive:** We foster a welcoming and inclusive community. Please treat all contributors with respect and maintain a professional demeanor in all interactions.

##  Evaluation Procedure and Toolchain

This project leverages a combination of automated and manual testing procedures to evaluate government websites against the GIGW 3.0 guidelines.   

Here's a high-level overview of the technical aspects of the evaluation process:

* **Automated Testing Infrastructure:**  We utilize a cloud-based scanning platform to handle the evaluation of a large number of websites. The platform hosts open-source scanning tools and provides the necessary infrastructure for automated testing, data collection, and report generation.
* **Website Crawling and Mapping:** We use web crawlers, like those integrated into OWASP ZAP, to automatically crawl target websites and gather information about their structure, links, and resources.
* **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:**  We use open-source vulnerability scanning tools such as OWASP ZAP, Nikto, SQLMap, and Wapiti to scan websites for known vulnerabilities. These tools are configured to run a comprehensive set of tests relevant to the GIGW 3.0 security guidelines.
* **Performance and Accessibility Testing:** We conduct automated performance and accessibility evaluations using tools like Lighthouse to generate quantitative data on page load times, accessibility compliance, and adherence to best practices.
* **Results Aggregation and Prioritization:** Results from the scanning tools and performance tests are aggregated into a central database. Vulnerabilities are prioritized based on their severity and potential impact, using industry-standard vulnerability scoring systems like CVSS. 
* **Detailed Technical Reports:**  The evaluation process generates detailed technical reports for each website, outlining identified vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and accessibility issues. The reports include specific remediation advice tailored to the issue and the website's technology.

We encourage contributors with expertise in these areas to get involved and help us improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our evaluation procedure.
